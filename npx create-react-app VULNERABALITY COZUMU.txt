It's an NPM Bug. See here for a longer explanation. You just need to put react-scripts in dev dependices like that

in package.json

"dependencies": {
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2",
   },
  "devDependencies": {
    "react-scripts": "4.0.3"
  },

bundan sonra terminalde

npm audit --production
